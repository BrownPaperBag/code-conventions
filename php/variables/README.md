# Variables

Variables names should be short but descriptive. 

### GOOD
```
$products = array('car', 'house');
$deletedIssue = 'all of them';
```

### BAD
```
$prod = array('car', 'house');
$delIss = 'all of them';
```

Keep variable names as short as possible, but avoid using acronyms or shortening words.
**Do not use single character variable names under any circumstances**
