# Conditionals

``JavaScript
if (value === 'a value') {

}
```

### Note
 - Single space between `if` and the first `(`
 - Single space between the final `)` and the opening `{`
 - The opening `{` is on the same line as the conditional statement

- - -

```JavaScript
if (value === 'a value') {

} else {

}
```

### Note
 - The `else` does not get it's own line. Vertical space is important and must be used parsimoniously, within reason

- - -

```JavaScript
if (value === 'a value') {

} else if (value === 'another value') {

} else {

}
```

### Note
 - The `else if` does not get it's own line. Vertical space is important and must be used parsimoniously, within reason
 - The `else if` follows the same basic rules as the `if`
