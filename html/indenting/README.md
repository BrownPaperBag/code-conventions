# Indenting

- Indent with 4 `spaces`, not `tabs`. Modify your editor to automate this
- HTML must be indented logically
- The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line element declaration must be
indented one tab-width further than the first line. See [Attributes](../attributes)
for an example of this
